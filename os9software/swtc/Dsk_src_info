           Disk Driver Source Code Usage Information

     This source code covers the three parts necessary to create
a working disk driver under OS-9.  These parts are:

    1) The Disk driver module itself
    2) The Disk boot module (installed in ROM)
    3) The Disk device descriptor modules

     The command lines to assemble each module are:

    1) asm XXX_drvr_src #12k
    2) asm XXX_boot_src #12k
    3) asm XXX_desc_src #12k
       "XXX" varies with the disk driver name
 
     Of course this will only do the  assembly  giving  any error  
messages.   See the assembler manual for options to obtain object 
output and a listing.


NOTE:  If you do not already  have a sysdefs file set up for your
system, it will be necessary to copy the given "Sysdefs.dsk" file
into your  DEFS.  In addition please note that it is NOT possible
to configure the  sysdefs file to EXACTLY match every system that
Microware supports.  Therefore it is the user's responsibility to
insure the sysdefs truly defines his own system.
