`Boot_ed0` and `OS9p2_ed5` come from os9l1v12.u7.
`Boot_ed1` and `OS9p1_ted` are extracted from a GIMIX computer owned by Ted Niespodziany.

The only difference in the two Boot modules is the copyright statement.

The difference between `OS9p1_ted` and `OS9p1_ed12` in the kernel directory is in the DATINT code.
