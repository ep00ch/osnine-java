Sources for OS-9/6809
=====================

The purpose of this directory is to preserve or reconstruct as much of the original software as possible on as many platforms as possible. This will make it easier to get OS-9 running on antique hardware such as the GIMIX or SWTPC systems. The objective is not to improve the software, but to preserve it as it was built and sold 40+ years ago.

If you want to use OS-9 for games the business software then I propose you check out NitrOS-9.

Some of the files are from http://geneslinuxbox.net:6309/gene/Genes-os9-stf/OS-9_Source.tar.gz. Others are disassembled by volunteers over the last two decades.
