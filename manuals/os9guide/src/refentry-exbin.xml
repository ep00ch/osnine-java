<para>
S-Record files are a type of text file that contains records that
represent binary data in hexadecimal character form. This
Motorola-standard format is often directly accepted by commercial PROM
programmers, emulators, logic analyzers and similar devices that are
interfaced RS-232 interfaces. It can also be useful for
transmitting files over data links that can only handle character-type
data; or to convert OS-9 assembler or compiler-generated
programs to load on non-OS-9 systems.
</para>
<para>
<quote><replaceable>Path1</replaceable></quote> is assumed to be an
S-Record format text file which <command>exbin</command> converts to pure binary form on
a new file called <quote><replaceable>path2</replaceable></quote>. The load addresses of each data record
must describe continguous data in ascending order.
</para>
<para>
<command>Exbin</command> does not generate or check for the proper OS-9 module
headers or CRC check value required to actually load the binary
file. The <command>ident</command> or <command>verify</command> commands can be used to check the
validity of the modules if they are to be loaded or run.
