The Macro Text Editor is a powerful and easy to use text preparation system.
It is commonly used to create source programs or other kinds of text files used
within the OS-9 system. The editor has many features that make editing faster and
more convenient. For example, most commands involve only one or two keystrokes.

The editor is kept in a file called "edit", which should be present in your system's
CMDS (execution) directory. To run the editor type:
<screen>
OS9: edit <keycap>RETURN</keycap>
</screen>
The editor should load and start. When it prints the "E:" prompt, it is
ready to accept a command. To quit, type a "Q" followed by a carriage return as follows:
<screen>
E: q <keycap>RETURN</keycap>
</screen>
