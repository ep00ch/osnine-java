<title>RunB</title>
<para>
RunB is the <productname>BASIC09</productname> run-time package.
It is similar to <productname>BASIC09</productname> with
the following exceptions: RunB is about half the size of <productname>BASIC09</productname> and no
file editing or debugging can be done. The main purpose of RunB is to
save space and to execute packed modules. It should be noted that RunB
will only execute packed modules. Another feature of RunB is that
CONTROL-C and CONTROL-Q can be trapped by ON ERROR GOTO where
<productname>BASIC09</productname> can't.
</para>
<para>
When the name of a packed module is typed at the OS-9 prompt,
Shell will determine that the module is packed <productname>BASIC09</productname> I-code.
Shell then loads and forks RunB, and RunB will link to and execute the named
program. To run packed modules in this way, RunB must be in the commands directory.
</para>
<para>
Packed modules can be executed without RunB, but <productname>BASIC09</productname> will have
to be used and more space will be required.
