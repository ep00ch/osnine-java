  <title>Notes on the Dragon OS-9 system disk</title>
  <para>
      The Dragon OS-9 system disk was created in the days around the 25th of November 1983.
  </para>
  <para>
An analysis of the OS-9 system disk for the Dragon 64 home computer shows details on how it was created.
This is possible as the RBF manager has a tendency to place the files in sequence starting from the top of the disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   When LSN is mentioned then this refers to the Logical Sector Number in hexadecimal, where the file or the file descriptor resides.

    <para>
The files in the CMDS directory have creation dates that vary by months. The disk is a backup of another disk, that contained the following files:

    <para>
    Go51 and acia51 were added separately. Their file descriptors are at LSN 001A and LNS 0025 respectively.
    The modification dates are 83/11/25 15:50 are 83/11/25 16:35 respectively.
</para>
<para>
    At some point the files <filename>asm</filename>, <filename>debug</filename> and <filename>edit</filename> were deleted.
    This happened rather late in the proces as they are fully recoverable. No sector was overwritten by other save operations.
    After <filename>asm</filename> was deleted the <filename>RUNB</filename> was added. It occupies the same location in the directory. When <filename>RUNB</filename> was added, the programmer had booted without setting the date on the computer.
</para>
    <para>
The SYS directory was created after the commands were added. It is located at LSN 0175 immediately after Xmode.
The directory contains the following files, which are then placed immediately after.
</para>
    <simplelist type="horiz" columns="5">
      <member>errmsg</member>
      <member>password</member>
      <member>motd</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>
The DEFS directory was created next.
</para>
    <simplelist type="horiz" columns="5">
      <member>OS9Defs</member>
      <member>RBFDefs</member>
      <member>SCFDefs</member>
      <member>SysType</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>
Then the startup file in the root directory was added.
</para>
    <para>
Then Cobbler and OS9gen were replaced with new editions that are located at LSN 0209 and LSN 020C. The creation date for both is 83/11/03.

</para>
    <para>
What happens next is that a bootfile is copied to the disk. It starts a LSN 024A. It contains the kernel modules mentioned below.
Immediately after are the kernel modules individually:
TERM (027A),
ACIA51 (027B),
T2 (027E),
PRINTER (027F),
P (0280),
PipeMan (0281),
Piper (0285, 83/12/05 14:49),
Pipe, Clock, Sysgo, Shell, T1, P1.
The directory containing the pointers to the files appears to have been placed at LSN 003B.
This directory holds deleted entries for D2, D3, SCF, KBVDIO and TERM.
These files were deleted before RunB was added.

At LSN 0143 there was a file descriptor where the file used 13 sectors.
At LSN 0144 there was a file descriptor where the file used 4 sectors.
D0 had a file descriptor at LSN 0145, which means it was added after OS9gen was replaced and deleted before RunB was added. The creation date was 83/11/25 and last modified date 83/12/05.
D1 had a file descriptor at LSN 0146.
D2 had a file descriptor at LSN 0147.
D3 had a file descriptor at LSN 0233, but this has been overwritten by RunB.
TERM has a file descriptor at LSN 0245, and the segment list points to LSN 027A. The creation date was 83/11/25 and last modified date 83/12/05 14:38.
</para>
<para>
RunB was added. It is located at LSN 0210-23F9. <!-- FIXME 23F9 -->
</para>
<para>
    The OS9Boot was created 83/11/25 16:38.
</para>
    <para>
Then comes a script to copy some files, go51 (LSN 029A, different from the go51 in CMDS), the makeboot file (LSN 02A4), the p1 source file, the defsfile,
t1 source file and the read.me file. The OBJECT directory was located at LSN 003D, but is partly overwritten.

      <title>The read.me file</title>
      <para>
This file is deleted on the disk.
Note that no line is longer than 51 characters.
The programmer worked on this file while in 51x24 mode.
File descriptor at LSN 02B4. Creation date is 83/11/29, last modified 83/12/05 14:36.
</para>
      <literallayout>
This directory contains the source files for the
device descriptors p1 and t1. The directory
OBJECT contains the object for these two
modules, plus the original OS-9 boot file
broken down into modules. In addition, there
is a procedure file MAKEBOOT, which merges
a selection of modules into a file called
BOOTFILE. This file may then be used with
the OS9GEN command to make a new boot file
on the system disk. Example commands:
  OS9: chd /d1/modules/object
  OS9: makeboot
  OS9: os9gen /d0
       bootfile
              
  OS9:
Note that OS9GEN expects the filename to
be entered, followed by a blank line to
terminate (CR only).
To alter the boot file, it is only necessary
to edit the MERGE command line in MAKEBOOT
to merge together the required modules.
Note that the present bootfile includes
P1 and T1, though not ACIA51. This is because
the device descriptors only take up $3A bytes
in the bootfile, but if loaded after booting
would each take a full page (256 bytes).

NOTE: I am not sure that the FORMAT program
puts the boot loading sectors on the disk.
Therefore when using OS9GEN to create a new
bootfile, this must be done to a disk that
is a BACKUP of an existing system disk.
