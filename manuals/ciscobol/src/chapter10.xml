    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <para>
Standard ANSI COBOL debugging provides a means by which the user can
describe the conditions under which procedures are to be
monitored during the execution of the object program.

    <title>CIS COBOL RUN-TIME DEBUG EXTENSION</title>
    <para>
      <phrase role="extension">The CIS COBOL Run-Time Debug Package is an extension to ANSI COBOL that
provides break-point facilities in the user's program. Programs may be run
from the start until a specified break-point is reached, when control is
passed back to the user. At this point, data areas may be inspected or changed.</phrase>

    <title>CIS COBOL RUN-TIME DEBUG EXTENSION</title>
    <para>
      <phrase role="extension">The Run-Time debug is entered as an option by the user and the user
program is then tested line by line, paragraph by paragraph and so on as
required. The commands to the package can reference procedure statements
and data areas by means of a 4-digit hexadecimal code output by the compiler
against each line of the compilation listing. Powerful macros of commands
can be used to give very sophisticated debugging facilities. The precise
details for using the package vary according to the host operating system,
and are therefore contained in the <citetitle pubwork="book">CIS COBOL Operating Guide</citetitle>
for your Operating System.</phrase>

    <title>STANDARD ANSI COBOL DEBUG</title>
    <para>
The decisions of what to monitor and what information to display are
explicitly in the domain of the user. The COBOL Debug facility simply
provides a convenient access to pertinent information.
        </para>
    <para>
The features of the language that support the COBOL Debug module are:

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
The reserved word DEBUG-ITEM is the name for a special register generated
automatically by the compiler that supports the debugging facility. Only
one DEBUG-ITEM is allocated per program. The names of the subordinate data
items in DEBUG-ITEM are also reserved words.
        </para>
    <section>
      <title>COMPILE TIME SWITCH</title>
      <para>
The DEBUGGING MODE clause is written as part of the SOURCE-COMPUTER
paragraph in the Environment Division. It serves as a compile-time switch
over debugging statements written in the program.
</para>
      <para>
When DEBUGGING MODE is not specified in a program, all the debugging lines
are compiled as if they were comment lines and their syntax is not checked.
</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>COBOL DEBUG OBJECT TIME SWITCH</title>
      <para>
An object time switch dynamically activates the debugging code inserted by
the compiler. This switch cannot be addressed in the program; it is
controlled outside the COBOL environment. If the switch is 'on', the
effects of any USE FOR DEBUGGING statements written in the source program
are permitted. If the switch is 'off', all the effects described in the USE
FOR DEBUGGING Statement, are inhibited. Recompilation of the source program
is not required to provide or take away this facility.
</para>
      <para>
The object time switch has no effect on the execution of the object program
if the WITH DEBUGGING MODE clause was not specified in the source program at
compile time.
The switch is described in the <citetitle pubwork="book">CIS COBOL Operating Guide</citetitle>.

A debugging line is any line with a 'D' in the indicator area of the line.
Any debugging line that consists solely of spaces from margin A to margin R

comment lines.

        <para>
A debugging line will be considered to have all the characteristics of a
comment line, if the WITH DEBUGGING MODE clause is not specified in the
SOURCE-COMPUTER paragraph.
</para>
        <para>
Successive debugging lines are allowed. Continuation of debugging lines is
permitted, except that each continuation line must contain a 'D' in the
indicator area, and character-strings may not be broken across two lines.

A debugging line is only permitted in the program after the OBJECT-COMPUTER
