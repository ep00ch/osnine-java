<title>Sequential Character File Manager</title>

<para>The Sequential Character File Manager (SCF) is the OS-9 file
manager module that supports devices that operate on a
character-by-character basis, such as terminals, printers, modems, etc. SCF
can handle any number or type of such devices. It is a reentrant
subroutine package called by IOMAN for I/O service requests to
sequential character-oriented devices. It includes the extensive
input and output editing functions typical of line-oriented
operation such as: backspace, line delete, repeat line, auto line
feed. Screen pause, return delay padding, etc.</para>

<para>Standard OS-9 systems are supplied with SCF and two SCF-type
device driver modules: ACIA, which run 6850 serial interfaces, and
PIA, which drives a 6821-type parallel interface for printers.</para>

<sect1>
<title>SCF Line Editing Functions</title>

<para><xref linkend="i.read"/> and <xref linkend="i.write"/>
service requests to SCF-type devices (which correspond to Basic09
GET and PUT statements) pass data to/from the
device without any modification. In particular, carriage returns are not
automatically followed by line feeds or nulls, and the high order
bits are passed as sent/received. If X-on and X-off are enabled, these
characters are intercepted by the device driver.</para>

<para><xref linkend="i.readln"/> and <xref linkend="i.writln"/>
service requests (which correspond to Basic09
INPUT, PRINT, READ and WRITE statements) to SCF-type devices
perform full line editing of all functions enabled for the particular
device. These functions are initialized when the device is first used
by copying the option table from the device descriptor table
associated with the specific device. They may be altered anytime
afterwards from assembly language programs using the <xref linkend="i.setstt"/> and
<xref linkend="i.getstt"/> service requests,
or from the keyboard using the <command>tmode</command>
command. Also, all bytes transferred in this mode will have the high
order bit cleared.</para>

<para>The following path descriptor values control the line editing
functions:
</para>

<para>If PD.UPC &lt;&gt; 0 bytes input or output in the range <quote>a..z</quote> are made
<quote>A..Z</quote></para>

<para>If PD.EKO &lt;&gt; 0, input bytes are echoed, except that
undefined control characters in the range $0..$1F print as <quote>.</quote>
</para>

<para>If PD.ALF &lt;&gt; 0, carriage returns are automatically followed
by line feeds.</para>

<para>If PD.NUL &lt;&gt; 0, After each CR/LF a PD.NUL <quote>nulls</quote> (always
$00) are sent.</para>

<para>If PD.PAU &lt;&gt; 0, Auto page pause will occur after every
PD.PAU lines since the last input.</para>

<para>If PD.BSP &lt;&gt; 0, SCF will recognize PD.BSP as the <quote>input</quote>
backspace character, and will echo PD.BSE (the backspace echo
character) if PD.BSO = 0, or PD.BSE, space, PD.BSE if PD.BSO &lt;&gt; 0.</para>

<para>If PD.DEL &lt;&gt; 0, SCF will recognize PD.DEL the delete line
character (on input), and echo the backspace sequence over the entire
line if PD.DLO = 0, or echo CR/LF if PD.DLO &lt;&gt; 0.</para>

<para>PD.EOR defines the end of record character. This is the last
character an each line entered (<xref linkend="i.readln"/>), and terminates the output
(<xref linkend="i.writln"/>) when this character is sent. Normally PD.EOR will be set
to $0D. If it is set to zero, SCF's <xref linkend="i.readln"/> will <emphasis>never</emphasis> terminate,
unless an EOF occurs.</para>

<para>
If PD.EOF &lt;&gt; 0, it defines the end of file character. SCF
will return an end-of-file error on <xref linkend="i.read"/> or <xref linkend="i.readln"/> if this is the
first (and only) character input. It can be disabled by setting its
value to zero.</para>

<para>
If PD.RPR &lt;&gt; 0, SCF (<xref linkend="i.readln"/>) will, upon receipt of this character, echo
a carriage return (and insert it in the buffer for <quote>DUP</quote> described
below), and then reprint the current line.
</para>
<para>
If PD.DUP &lt;&gt; 0, SCF (<xref linkend="i.readln"/>) will duplicate whatever is in the input
buffer through the first <quote>PD.EOR</quote> character.
</para>
<para>
If PD.PSC &lt;&gt; 0, output is suspended before the next <quote>PD.EOR</quote> character
when this character is input. This will also delete any <quote>type ahead</quote>
input for <xref linkend="i.readln"/>.
</para>
<para>
If PD.INT &lt;&gt; 0, and is received on input, a keyboard interrupt signal is
sent to the last user of this path. Also, it will terminate the current
I/O request (if any) with an error identical to the keyboard interrupt
signal code. PD.INT normally is set to a control-C character.
</para>
<para>
If PD.QUT &lt;&gt; 0, and is received on input, a keyboard abort signal is sent
to the last user of this path. Also it will terminate the current I/O
request (if any) with an error code identical to the keyboard interrupt
signal code. This location is normally set to a control-Q character.
</para>
<para>
If PD.OVF &lt;&gt; 0, it is echoed when <xref linkend="i.readln"/> has satisfied its input byte
count without finding a <quote>PD.EOR</quote> character.
</para>
<para>
NOTE: It is possible to disable most of these special editing functions
by setting the corresponding control character in the path descriptor to
zero by using the <xref linkend="i.setstt"/> service request, or by running the <command>tmode</command>
utility. A more permanent solution may be had by setting the
corresponding control character value in the device descriptor module to
zero.
</para>
<para>
Device descriptors may be inspected to determine the default settings for
these values for specific devices.

option section of the path descriptor contains many device operating
parameters which may be read or written by the OS9 <xref linkend="i.getstt"/> or <xref linkend="i.setstt"/>
service requests. IOMAN initializes this section when a path is opened
by copying the corresponding device descriptor initialization table. Any

<title>SCF Device Driver Storage Definitions</title>

<para>An SCF-type device driver module contains a package of
subroutines that perform raw I/O transfers to or from a specific
hardware controller. These modules are usually reentrant so one
copy of the module can simultaneously run several different devices
that use identical I/O controllers. For each
<quote>incarnation</quote> of the driver, IOMAN will allocate a static storage
area for that device driver. IOMAN determines that a new incarnation of
the device driver is needed when an attach occurs for a device with a
'different port address. The size of the storage area is given in the
device driver module header. Some of this storage area is required by
IOMAN and SCF, the device driver is free to use the remainder for
variables and buffers. This static storage is defined in OS9 <filename>IODEFS</filename> and
OS9 <filename>SCFDEFS</filename> as:

<para>V.PAGE, V.PORT These three bytes are defined by IOMAN to be the 24
bit device address.</para>

<para>V.LPRC This location contains the process-ID of the last process
to use the device. The IRQ service routine is responsible for sending
this process the proper signal in case a <quote>QUIT</quote> character
or an <quote>INTERRUPT</quote> character is received. Maintained by SCF.</para>

<para>V. BUSY This location contains the process ID of the process
currently using the device (zero if it is not being used). This is
used by SCF to prevent more than one process from using the
device at the same moment. Defined by SCF.</para>

<para>V.WAKE This location contains the process ID of any process that is
waiting for the device to complete I/O (or zero if there is none
waiting). The interrupt service routine should check this location to
see if a process is waiting and if so, send it a wake up signal.
Maintained by the device driver.
</para>

<para>V.TYPE This location contains any special characteristics of a device.
It is typically used as a value to initialize the device control
register, for parity etc. It is maintained by SCF which copies its value
from PD.PAR in the path descriptor.</para>

<para>
V.LINE This location contains the number of lines left till end of page.
Paging is handled by SCF.
</para>
<para>
V.PAUS This location is a flag used by SCF to indicate that a pause
character has been received. Setting its value to anything other than
zero will cause SCF to stop transmitting characters at the end of the
next line. Device driver input routines must set V.PAUS in the ECHO
device's static storage area. SCF will check this value in the ECHO
device's static storage when output is sent.
</para>
<para>
V.DEV2 This location contains the address of the ECHO (attached)
device's static storage area. Typically a device is its own echo device.
However, it may not be, as in the case of a keyboard and a memory mapped
video display. Maintained by SCF.
</para>
<para>
V.INTR Keyboard interrupt character. This is maintained by SCF, which
copies its value from PD.INT in the path descriptor.
</para>
<para>
V.QUIT Keyboard abort character. This is maintained by SCF which copies
its value from PD.QUT in the path descriptor.
</para>
<para>
V.PCHR Pause character. This is maintained by SCF which copies its
value from PD.PSC in the path descriptor.
</para>
<para>
V.ERR This location is used to accumulate I/O errors. Typically it is
used by the IRQ service routine to record errors so that they may be
reported later when SCF calls one of the device driver routines.

<title>SCF Device Driver Subroutines</title>

As with all device drivers, SCF device drivers use a standard
executable memory module format with a module type of <quote>device driver</quote>
(CODE $EO). The execution offset address in the module header points to
a branch table that has six three byte entries. Each entry is typically
a LBRA to the corresponding subroutine. The branch table is as follows:

<para>Usually this routine has three basic operations to do:</para>

<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>Initialize the device static storage.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Place the IRQ service routine on the IRQ polling list by using
the OS9 <xref linkend="f.irq"/> service request.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Initialize the device control registers (enable interrupts if
necessary).</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>NOTE: Prior to being called, the device static storage will be
cleared (set to zero) except for V.PAGE and V.PORT which will contain
the 24 bit device address. There is no need to initialize the portion
of static storage used by IOMAN and SCF.</para>

<para>This routine should get the next character from the input
buffer. If there is no data ready, this routine should copy its
process ID from V.BUSY into V.WAKE and then use the <xref linkend="f.sleep"/>
service request to put itself to sleep indefinately.</para>

<para>Later when data is received, the IRQ service routine will leave
the data in a buffer, then check V.WAKE to see if any process is
waiting for the device to complete I/O. If so, the IRQ service
routine should send a wakeup signal to it.</para>

<para>NOTE: Data buffers for queueing data between the main driver and the IRQ
service routine are <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically allocated. It any are
used, they should be defined in the device's static storage area.</para>

<para>This routine places a data byte into an output buffer and enables
the device output interrupts. It the data buffer is already full,
this routine should copy its process ID from V.BUSY into V.WAKE and
then put itself to sleep.</para>

<para>Later when the IRQ service routine transmits a character and makes
room for more data in the buffer, it will check V.WAKE to see if
there is a process waiting for the device to complete I/O. It there
is, it sends a wake up signal to that process.</para>

<para>NOTE: This routine must ensure that the IRQ service routine will
start up when data is placed into the buffer. After an interrupt is
generated the IRQ service routine will continue to transmit data
until the data butter is empty, and then it will disable the device's
<quote>ready to transmit</quote> interrupts.</para>

<para>
This routine is a wild card call used to get (set) the device
parameters specified in the <xref linkend="i.getstt"/>
and <xref linkend="i.setstt"/> service requests.
Most SCF-type requests are handled by IOMAN or SCF. Any codes not defined by
them will be passed to the device driver.
</para>

<para>In writing getstat/setstat codes, it may be necessary to examine or
change the register stack which contains the values of the 6809 registers
at the time the OS9 service request was issued. The address of the
register packet may be found in PD.RGS, which is located in the path
descriptor. Note that Y is a pointer to the path descriptor and PD.RGS
is the offset in the path descriptor. The following offsets may be used
to access any particular value in the register stack:

<para>
This routine is called when a device is no longer in use, defined as
when its use count in the device table becomes zero. In Level One
systems, the termination routine is not called until the link count of
the driver, descriptor, or file manager also reaches zero, and the module
is being removed from the system memory directory. It must perform the
following:
</para>
<para>
1. Wait until the output buffer has been emptied (by the IRQ service
routine).
</para>
<para>
2. Disable device interrupts.
</para>
<para>
3. Remove device from the IRQ polling list.
</para>
<para>
NOTE: LI - Modules contained in the BOOT file will NOT be terminated.
LII - Any I/O devices that are not being used will be
terminated.

device drivers. The main things that it does are:
</para>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<para>Service the device interrupts (receive data from device or send
data to it). This routine should put its data into and get its data
from buffers which are defined in the device static storage.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Wake up any process waiting for I/O to complete by checking
to see if there is a process ID in V.WAKE (non-zero) and it so
send a wakeup signal to that process.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the device is ready to send more data and the output buffer
is empty, disable the device's <quote>ready to transmit</quote>
interrupts.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If a pause character is received, set V.PAUS in the attached
device static storage to a non-zero value. The address of the
attached device static storage is in V.DEV2.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If a keyboard abort or interrupt character is received,
signal the process in V.LPRC (last known process) if any.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
When the IRQ service routine finishes servicing an interrupt,
it must clear the carry and exit with an RTS instruction.
