Multi-user OS-9 emulation
=========================

The intent of this emulator is to create a GUI that supports two serial terminals at 80x24, one serial printer and a 5 MB harddisk. There will be a realtime clock, which is patched into the host clock.

The terminals and printer will be implemented using an ACIA 68050.
