# OS-9 GMX I version 1.2

The GIMIX had OS-9 in ROM.

These files are from http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/Gimix/
The disk was originally in ImageDisk format, and the content was extracted and sector interleave normalised.
The ROMS are from the MAME project. The kernel in os9l1v11.u6 is a very early version that doesn't have the edition byte.
It does not fit the disk image.
