# OS-9 GMX I version 1.2

This is a configuration for the v6809 emulator.

The GIMIX had OS-9 in ROM.

The disk was originally in ImageDisk format, and the content was
extracted and sector interleave normalised.  The ROMS are from the MAME
project. The kernel in os9l1v11.u6 is a very early version that doesn't
have the edition byte.  It does not fit the disk image. The emulation
is using a fresh assembly from the OS-9 source distribution.
