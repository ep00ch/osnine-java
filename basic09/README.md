# BASIC09 programs

Most of these are downloaded from http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html and modified to use more of Basic09's structured statements.

One of BASIC09 few weaknesses is the inability to make dynamic array sizes. In this case the DIM statements have a numeric constant containing a reasonably large size.
