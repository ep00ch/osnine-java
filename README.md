# Retrocomputing: A Java-based 6809 emulator

The purpose of this emulator is to run the Microware OS-9 or NitroOS9.
It doesn't emulate real hardware. Instead it requires the kernel to
be loaded with special device drivers that interact with virtual consoles
and harddisks.

The 6809 was an 8-bit CPU with some 16-bit features from Motorola introduced in the late 70-ies.
