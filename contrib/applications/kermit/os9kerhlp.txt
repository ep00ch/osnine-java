Os9 kermit (Glen Seaton/Robert Larson/James Jones) (02/26/86) (ral)

  Read os9ker.bwr for known bugs and limitations

Os9 kermit compilation instructions:

Compilation switches:
  -dCOCO          Same as -dtps=60 -dnooverlap

  -dtps=number    Set ticks per second.  100 assumed for OSK, gotten from 
                  <time.h> otherwise.  (<time.h> is often wrong or needs 
                  its own compilation switch.)

  -dnooverlap     Specifies that disk i/o and serial i/o cannot occur at the
                  same time.  Hopefully only needed for COCO.  Slows down  
                  transfer if not needed.  (Avoids timeouts if it is needed.)
                  (also needed for QT+ floppies)

  -dticstosleep=number
                  Specifies number of ticks to sleep between checking for
                  input while waiting for packet.  Making it bigger makes
                  timeouts more accurate.  Making it to big will slow file
                  transfers.  Default value is 4, minimum is 1.  Aprox. 
                  1/10 second is recomended.

  -dtimeoutint=number
                  Number of "seconds" until timeout.  (Inacurate.)  Default
                  15.    

  -dOSK           Os9/68000.  Defined by os9/68000 compiler.  Has several 
                  effects, including defining SLEEPOK and SGXONOFF.
                  
  -dSLEEPOK       The sleep function should be used rather than a macro that
                  calls tsleep.  (Coco os9 sleep is wrong, and other 6809
                  versions should be checked.)
                  
  -dSGXONOFF      SCF drivers handle xon/xoff.  Assumed for OSK and probably
                  to be added to os9/6809.

  -f=kermit       Specifys name of compiled program.


Compilation:

Os9/68000: 
rename os9ker.mak to makefile, edit compilation options if needed,
and use the make command.  I had problems with the -d compiler option 
(aparently bugs in the compiler (1.3, microware reported that they could 
not reporduce my problems) so had to put #define statements in 
os9inc.h.  The QT+ needs tps to be 10 and nooverlap for floppy operation.

Os9/6809:
CC os9ker.c os9get.c os9sen.c os9rec.c os9srv.c os9utl.c os9raw.c os9con.c
   os9qui.c -f=kermit [other options]

   By CC I mean cc1 or cc2 as apropriate.

Use:

   Some device drivers will drop dtr when the serial line is closed.
This will cause some modems to hang up, and some comnputers to log you
out.  Iniz can sometimes be used to fix this problem, i.e. iniz the
device before using it.  The coco os9 2.0 /aciapak driver is one of 
these, so "iniz t2" before using kermit on a coco.

Coco:

   When using the r.s. aciapak with the supplied /t2 driver, the
aciapak must be in slot 1 of your multipak.  Also see the note above
and the notes in the .bwr file on the use of the bit banger port (/t1).
