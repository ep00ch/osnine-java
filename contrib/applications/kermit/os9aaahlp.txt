Subject: Os9 kermit is known to work

The os9 kermit I sent you (and you are distributing) is know to work on
the following os9 systems.  Sorry it took so long to compile this list,
but the answers to my message slowly trickled in.

Os9 Level I: (6809)

    Radio Shack Color Computer (coco) with either a radio-shack rs232-pak
    (hardware serial port) or a homebrew 6551 board.

    S100 system based on an Ackerman Digial 6809 board.

    Systems based on a Finland club's boards.

    A homebrew system.

Os9 Level II: (6809)

    Gimex III

Os9 68000:

    A homebrew system.


Homebrew os9 systems seem to be popular.
