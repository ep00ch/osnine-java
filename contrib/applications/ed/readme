This is the 'ed' editor as known from Unix-like systems. The source
comes from MINIX and was compiled with virtually no changes, except
for adding small things like pflinit() etc.

To compile the source files use 'makeobjs'. This script will
compile each file to a linkable object-file. Then create the
edobjs.l library with the script 'makelib'. Finally use 'makeed'
to link the editor.

If the c-compiler runs out of memory while compiling some of the
larger source files, then try running the compile-command again
outside the shell-scripts. Those shell-scripts take some space
in RAM.

The editor is linked with a memory size of 6 kbytes. Ed will use
malloc to request memory for the text file, so if you run out of
memory, you might get better performance by *lowering* the
memory size.

There is no user-guide. Use anyone from a UNIX-system, but beware
that newer systems such as Linux has more commands in 'ed'. A
quick hint is that there are two modes in 'ed'. The command mode
and insert mode. You exit the editor from command mode by typing
q<ret>. Sometimes it needs confirmation, and you simply repeat
the q<ret>. You enter insert mode by typing i<ret> or a<ret> and
you return to command mode with a single . on an empty line.

Install ed by copying the ed file to your execution directory.
