Advent [-r][file]
        -r - Resume saved game.
             (Advent will prompt for filename.)
        If "file" is present, advent will tack on ".adv" and
         try to restart it as a saved game.
         Magic is said to work in the cave.  Your computer
         will be your eyes and hands.  Use commands of 1 or 2
         words.  Only the first five letters of each word are
         significant, so you'll have to enter "Northeast" as
         "ne" to distinguish it from "North".  (Should you
         get stuck, type "help" for some general hints).
